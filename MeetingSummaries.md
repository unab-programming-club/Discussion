For our second meeting, Thor presented on the javascript behind the in-browser APOSTLE visualizer (located at http://www.astro.uvic.ca/~thoroldt/H1C/visualizer/ - you need to allow pop-ups for the tool to work). The topic covered the methods behind displaying large numbers of transparent sprites of different colours effectively using GPU shaders.

We had our first meeting to organize the club!!

We arrived to some decisions:

 - Meetings will be biweekly starting next friday at 12:00
 - Meetings will have a presenter with a general topic
 - Next meeting We have to start asking for and discussing project proposals
 - We have to set up a website/forum for discussion (this github group/repository)
 
There was particular interest by the group on this subjects:

  - Migrating to python from IDL
  - Python speed performance on fitting tasks
